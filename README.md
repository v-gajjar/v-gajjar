# Hi, I'm Vinay! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me

- I'm actively seeking my next Software Developer role.
- I landed my first tech job through fellow volunteers, whilst helping out a local charity shop.
- I voluntered at the 2023 Manchester Tech Festival and have since been going to a lot of Tech meetups. 

### To celebrate my 7+ yrs in Software Development, here's 7 things I love:

- Music. My taste is very varied, but my absolute favouite genres are Bhangra and UK Garage.
- A good coffee. Machu Picchu are my favourite beans.
- Chocolate. I love white, milk, and dark varieties (up to 70% cocoa content)
- Pasta. Mac n Cheese is the ULTIMATE comfort food!!
- Puzzles. My Uncle taught me to solve Sudokus in my teen years. And I'm currently working through my second 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle!
- Sunflowers. During the Pandemic, lots of bright and tall ones dominated the garden.
- Colour. The world would be a dull place without it!
